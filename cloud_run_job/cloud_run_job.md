# Cloud Run Jobs Version of Weather Ingestion

## Key Differences from FastAPI Service and Cloud Function

### **Cloud Run Job** (`job_fetch_write.py`):
- **Entry point**: `main()` function that runs to completion
- **No HTTP interface**: Pure batch processing script
- **Error handling**: `sys.exit(1)` for failures (job fails completely)
- **Deployment**: Containerized with Docker (like services)
- **Execution**: Run-to-completion, then container stops

## Comparison

| Aspect | FastAPI Service | Cloud Function | Cloud Run Job |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Framework** | FastAPI + Uvicorn | functions-framework | **Pure Python script** |
| **HTTP Interface** | ✅ Full REST API | ✅ Single HTTP endpoint | **❌ No HTTP** |
| **Containerization** | ✅ Docker required | ❌ Just code | **✅ Docker required** |
| **Deployment** | Cloud Build + Docker | Direct upload | **Cloud Build + Docker** |
| **Runtime Limits** | Unlimited | 9 minutes max | **Unlimited** |
| **Memory Limits** | Up to 32GB | Up to 8GB | **Up to 32GB** |
| **Cold Start** | ~1-3 seconds | ~100ms | **~1-3 seconds** |
| **Execution Model** | Always ready for requests | Triggered by requests | **Run once and exit** |
| **Complexity** | Medium | Lowest | **Low** |

## CI/CD Deployment (Same as FastAPI!)


1. **Push code to GitHub**
2. **Cloud Build trigger fires automatically** 
3. **`cloudbuild.yaml` handles everything**

Same workflow as your FastAPI services - just different `gcloud run jobs create` commands in the YAML instead of `gcloud run deploy`.

## Advantages of Cloud Run Jobs

1. **Perfect for batch processing**: Designed for run-to-completion tasks
2. **No idle resources**: Container only runs when executing
3. **Container flexibility**: Full Docker environment control
4. **Unlimited runtime**: No 9-minute function limit
5. **High resource limits**: Up to 32GB RAM, 8 vCPUs
6. **Built-in retry**: Job-level retry and failure handling
7. **Parallelization**: Can run multiple tasks in parallel

## Disadvantages of Cloud Run Jobs

1. **Same deployment complexity**: Requires Docker + Cloud Build (like FastAPI)
2. **Slower cold starts**: Container startup vs function  
3. **No HTTP interface**: Can't test manually via browser/curl
4. **Different scheduling**: Need to call job execution API vs HTTP endpoint

## For Your Daily Weather Pipeline

**Cloud Run Jobs is perfect when:**
- You want pure batch processing semantics
- No need for HTTP endpoints
- Want container portability and flexibility
- Need more than 9 minutes runtime
- Processing large datasets that need more memory

**Stick with FastAPI Services if:**
- You want to teach microservices patterns
- Students need to test endpoints manually
- Building a larger system with APIs

**Use Cloud Functions if:**
- Want absolute simplest deployment
- Job completes in under 9 minutes
- Don't need custom runtime environment

## Code Structure Differences

### **FastAPI Service**:
```python
@app.post("/run")
def run(location: str = None):
    # Process and return HTTP response
    return {"status": "success"}
```

### **Cloud Function**:
```python
@functions_framework.http
def weather_ingestion(request):
    # Process and return HTTP response
    return {"status": "success"}
```

### **Cloud Run Job**:
```python
def main():
    # Process and exit
    print("Job completed")
    sys.exit(0)  # Success

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Bottom Line**: Cloud Run Jobs are ideal for your daily weather ingestion if you want pure batch processing without HTTP complexity!
